# Mountain-Climbing-Creature-AI
**Overview**
This project aims to create virtual creatures that can climb a mountain using machine learning algorithms. The creatures' movement and navigation are powered by a custom-trained model, and their fitness is evaluated based on their proximity to the mountain peak.

**Features**
Basic framework for creating and simulating creatures
Machine learning model for creature movement
Fitness evaluation to guide evolutionary improvements
Simulation environment for testing and evolving creatures

**Understanding the Project**
Move: Creatures move randomly within the environment.
Fitness: Fitness is calculated based on how close each creature is to the target peak (less negative values are better).
Selection: The best creatures are selected to create the next generation.
Evolution: Over successive generations, fitness generally improves, indicating that creatures are evolving and getting closer to the peak.

**Files**
train.py: Script to train the creature's movement model (if applicable).
simulate.py: Script to run the mountain climbing simulation (if applicable).
best_creatures.json: JSON file containing data on the best-performing creatures from each generation.
Understanding.txt: Provides an explanation and understanding of the project's output and processes.
