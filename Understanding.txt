Output Understanding and Explanation:
Generation 0:

Creatures move to new positions.
Fitness values show how close each creature is to the target peak (less negative means closer).
Best creatures are selected for the next generation.
Generation 1 to 4:

Same process repeats: creatures move, fitness values are calculated, and best creatures are selected.
Fitness values generally get better each generation, showing creatures are evolving and getting closer to the peak.

Summary
Move: Creatures move randomly.
Fitness: Calculated based on closeness to the target (less negative is better).
Selection: Best creatures are picked to create the next generation.
Evolution: Fitness improves over generations, showing progress.
